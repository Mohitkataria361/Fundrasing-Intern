The Fundraising Intern Portal is a full-stack web application built with React.js on the frontend and Express.js on the backend. It features a dummy login page, a user dashboard that displays a referral code, donation stats, rewards, and a static leaderboard. The backend provides mock data via REST API, while the frontend uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Axios for API communication. The project is designed to simulate a real-world fundraising platform for interns
